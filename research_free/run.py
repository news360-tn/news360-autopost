Keep it 4-6 sentences, 38-55 words, numbers as Tamil words, no digits, no English letters. English words that people say in Tamil must be written in Tamil script so a Tamil voice pronounces them (மொபைல், ஆன்லைன், பஸ்). Keep the last sentence exactly: மேலும் செய்திகளுக்கு நாமக்கல் த்ரீ சிக்ஸ்டி பக்கத்தை பின்தொடருங்கள்.
3. slides_spec texts and caption: natural modern Tamil, no half-English sentences except fixed words (Follow, Share, Save). Keep the character limits (hl1 40, hl2 28, title 18, lines 60).
