"""Cloudinary clean-up (owner 12 Nov): the free plan filled up because every reel / picture was kept for ever.
Instagram and Facebook copy a file when they post it, so the Cloudinary copy is only needed until the post (and the Facebook
retries, at most 24 h) are done.

Every run (from the post workflow; at most once an hour):
  - files of THIS page's folder only (FOLDER, e.g. "news360") older than KEEP_H (72 h) are deleted
    (a story is posted only on the news day or the day after, so nothing still waiting is ever older than 48 h)
  - when the account has used CLEAN_AT % (50) of its monthly credits, reel VIDEOS (the big files) older than
    FULL_KEEP_H (26 h - the Facebook retries stay safe) are deleted too. Pictures are small and stay 72 h.
  - a prebuilt reel whose link was deleted is uploaded again by post.py (load_cache checks the links), so nothing fails.
Never touches other folders (other pages may share the same Cloudinary account).
Needs CLOUDINARY_CLOUD + CLOUDINARY_API_KEY + CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET (Cloudinary -> Settings -> API Keys); skipped without them.
Usage: python poster/cloudclean.py [--force] [--dry]       (prints counts only - the repo is public)
